# synteny_match
This code uses output file from synteny search by MCScan in Medicago truncatula and pea genome. The output file contains Medicago genes and its correspoding pea orthologs for a group of gene family called NCRs. This is to find how many non-NCR genes of pea are conserved nicely as a syntenic in the immediate vicinity of NCRs loci.
